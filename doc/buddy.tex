\chapter{Introduction}

BuDDy is a Binary Decision Diagram package that provides all of the
most used functions for manipulating BDDs. The package also includes
functions for integer arithmetics such as addition and relational
operators.

BuDDy started as a technology transfer project between the Technical
University of Denmark and Bann Visualstate. The later is now using the
techniques from BuDDy in their software. See {\tt
  www.visualstate.com}.

This manual describes only the interface to BuDDy, not the underlying
theory of BDDs. More information about that can be found in Henrik
Reif Andersen's ``An Introduction To Binary Decision Diagrams'' which
is supplied with the BuDDY distribution. Even more information can of
course be found in the original papers by Bryant, Rudell and
Brace~\cite{bryant-1986-gba, bryant-1990-eib, bryant-1992-sbm,
  rudell-1993-dvo}

\section{Getting BuDDy}

BuDDy can be found on the server {\tt http://www.itu.dk/research/buddy}.


% --------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Installing} \index{installing}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Edit the file "config" to specify your compiler and install options.
  
\item Type {\tt make} to make the binary.
  
\item Type {\tt make install} to copy the BDD files to their appropriate
  directories

\item Type {\tt make examples} to make the examples

\end{enumerate}


% --------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Compiling} \index{compiling}

This is rather simple. Just inform the compiler of where the binaries
and include files are installed. With Gnu C this is done with the {\tt
  -I} and {\tt -L} options.  Assuming that the binary library {\tt
  libbdd.a} is installed in {\tt /usr/local/lib} and the include file
{\tt bdd.h} is installed in {\tt /usr/local/include}, then the compile
command should be
%
\begin{Ill}
  {\tt cc -I/usr/local/include myfile.c -o myfile -L/usr/include/lib -lbdd}
\end{Ill}
%
If the above directories are included in your search path already, then
you might be able to reduce the command to
%
\begin{Illu}
  {\tt cc myfile.c -o myfile -lbdd}
\end{Illu}


% --------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Programming with BuDDy} \index{programming examples}

First of all a program needs to call {\tt
  bdd\_init(nodenum,cachesize)} to initialize the BDD package. The
{\tt nodenum} parameter sets the initial number of BDD nodes and {\tt
  cachesize} sets the size of the caches used for the BDD operators (not the
unique node table). These caches are used for {\tt bdd\_apply} anmong others.

Good initial values are
\\[\abovedisplayskip]

\begin{tabular}{lrr}
  {\bf Example} & {\bf nodenum} & {\bf cachesize} \\
  Small test examples & 1000 & 100 \\
  Small examples & 10000 & 1000 \\
  Medium sized examples & 100000 & 10000 \\
  Large examples & 1000000 & variable \\
\end{tabular}\\

\noindent
Too few nodes will only result in reduced performance as this
increases the number of garbage collections needed. If the package
needs more nodes, then it will automatically increase the size of the
node table.  Use {\tt bdd\_setminfreenodes} to change the parameters
for when this is done and use {\tt bdd\_setcacheratio} to enable
dynamical resizing of the operator caches. You may also use the
function {\tt bdd\_setmaxincrease} to adjust how BuDDy resizes the
node table.

After the initialization a call must be done to {\tt bdd\_setvarnum}
to define how many variables to use in this session. This number may
be increased later on either by calls to {\tt bdd\_setvarnum} or to
{\tt bdd\_extvarnum}.

The atomic functions for getting new BDD nodes are {\tt
  bdd\_ithvar(i)} and {\tt bdd\_nithvar(i)} which returns references
to BDD nodes of the form $(v_i,0,1)$ and $(v_i,1,0)$. The nodes
constructed in this way corresponds to the positive and negative
versions of a single variable.  Initially the variable order is $v_0 <
v_1 < \ldots < v_{n-1} < v_n$.
  
The BDDs returned from {\tt bdd\_ithvar(i)} can then be used to form
new BDDs by calling {\tt bdd\_apply(a,b,op)} where {\tt op} may be
{\tt bddop\_and} or any of the other operators defined in {\tt bdd.h}.
The apply function performs the binary operation indicated by {\tt
  op}.  Use {\tt bdd\_not} to negate a BDD.  The result from {\tt
  bdd\_apply} and any other BDD operator {\em must} be handed over to
{\tt bdd\_addref} to increase the reference count of the node before
any other operation is performed.  This is done to prevent the BDD
from being garbage collected. When a BDD is no longer in use, it can
be de-referenced by a call to {\tt bdd\_delref}.  The exceptions to
this are the return values from {\tt bdd\_ithvar} and {\tt
  bdd\_nithvar}. These do not need to be reference counted, although
it is not an error to do so. The use of the BDD package ends with a
call to {\tt bdd\_done}. See the figures~\ref{fig:cinterface} and
\ref{fig:cppinterface} for an example.

\begin{figure}[tb]
%\begin{Ill}
\begin{verbatim}
#include <bdd.h>

main(void)
{
   bdd x,y,z;

   bdd_init(1000,100);
   bdd_setvarnum(5);

   x = bdd_ithvar(0);
   y = bdd_ithvar(1);
   z = bdd_addref(bdd_apply(x,y,bddop_and));

   bdd_printtable(z);
   bdd_delref(z);
   bdd_done();
}
\end{verbatim}
%\end{Ill}
  \caption{Standard C interface to BuDDy. In this mode both 'bdd' and
    'BDD' can be used as BuDDy BDD types. The C interface requires the
    user to ensure garbage collection is handled correctly. This means
    calling 'bdd\_addref' every time a new BDD is created, and
    'bdd\_delref' whenever a BDD is not in use anymore.}
  \label{fig:cinterface}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[tb]
%\begin{Ill}
\begin{verbatim}
#include <bdd.h>

main(void)
{
   bdd x,y,z;

   bdd_init(1000,100);
   bdd_setvarnum(5);

   x = bdd_ithvar(0);
   y = bdd_ithvar(1);
   z = x & y;

   cout << bddtable << z << endl;

   bdd_done();
}
\end{verbatim}
%\end{Ill}
  \caption{C++ interface to BuDDy. In this mode 'bdd' is a C++ class
    that wraps a handler around the standard C interface, and the
    'BDD' type referes to the standard C BDD type. The C++ interface
    handles all garbage collection, so no calls to 'bdd\_addref' and
    'bdd\_delref' are needed.}
  \label{fig:cppinterface}
\end{figure}

Information on the BDDs can be found using the {\tt bdd\_var}, {\tt
  bdd\_low} and {\tt bdd\_high} functions that returns the variable
labelling a BDD, the low branch and the high branch of a BDD.

Printing BDDs is done using the functions {\tt bdd\_printall} that
prints {\em all} used nodes, {\tt bdd\_printtable} that prints the
part of the nodetable that corresponds to a specific BDD and {\tt
  bdd\_printset} that prints a specific BDD as a list of elements in
a set (all paths ending in the true terminal).

\subsection{More Examples}

More complex examples can be found in the {\tt buddy/examples} directory.

% --------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Variable sets} \index{variable sets}

For some functions like {\tt bdd\_exist} it is possible to pass a
whole set of variables to be quantified, using BDDs that represent the
variables. These BDDs are simply the conjunction of all the variables
in their positive form and can either be build that way or by a call
to {\tt bdd\_makeset}. For the {\tt bdd\_restrict} function the
variables need to be included in both positive and negative form which
can only be done manually.

If for example variable 1 and variable 3 are to be included in a set,
then it can be done in two ways, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:varset}.

\begin{figure}[tb]
\begin{verbatim}
#include <bdd.h>

main()
{
   bdd v1, v3;
   bdd seta, setb;
   static int v[2] = {1,3};
   
   bdd_init(100,100);
   bdd_setvarnum(5);

   v1 = bdd_ithvar(1);
   v3 = bdd_ithvar(3);

      /* One way */
   seta = bdd_addref( bdd_apply(v1,v3,bddop_and) );
   bdd_printtable(seta);

      /* Another way */
   setb = bdd_addref( bdd_makeset(v,2) );
   bdd_printtable(setb);
}
\end{verbatim}
  \caption{Two ways to create a variable set.}
  \label{fig:varset}
\end{figure}


% --------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Dynamic Variable Reordering} \index{reordering}
\index{variable reordering} \index{dynamic variable reordering}

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \input{varblock.pstex_t}
    \caption{The variable tree for the variable blocks $v_0\ldots v_9$,
      $v_1\ldots v_8$, $v_1\ldots v_4$, $v_5\ldots v_8$, $v_1$, $v_2$,
      $v_3$ and $v_4$.}
    \label{fig:vartree}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Dynamic variable reordering can be done using the functions {\tt
  bdd\_reorder(int method)} and {\tt bdd\_autoreorder(int method)}.
Where the parameter {\tt method}, for instance can be {\tt
  BDD\_REORDER\_WIN2ITE}.  The package must know how the BDD variables
are related to each other, so the user must define blocks of BDD
variables, using {\tt bdd\_addvarblock(bdd var, int fixed)}. A block
is a range of BDD variables that should be kept together. It may
either be a simple contiguous sequence of variables or a sequence of
other blocks with ranges inside their parents range. In this way all
the blocks form a tree of ranges. Partially overlapping blocks are not
allowed.

Example: Assume the block $v_0\ldots v_9$, is added as the first block
and then the block $v_1\ldots v_8$. This yields the $v_0\ldots v_9$
block at the top, with the $v_1\ldots v_8$ block as a child. If now
the block $v_1\ldots v_4$ was added, it would become a child of the
$v_1\ldots v_8$ block, similarly the block $v_5\ldots v_8$ would be a
child of the $v_1\ldots v_8$ block. If we add the variables $v_1$,
$v_2$, $v_3$ and $v_4$ as single variable blocks we at last get tree
showed in figure~\ref{fig:vartree}. If all variables should be added
as single variable blocks then {\tt bdd\_varblockall} can be used
instead of doing it manually.

The reordering algorithm is then to first reorder the top most blocks
and there after descend into each block and reorder these recursively
- unless the block is defined as a fixed block.

If the user want to control the swapping of variables himself, then
the functions {\tt bdd\_swapvar} {\tt bdd\_setvarorder} may be used.
But this is not possible in conjunction with the use of variable
blocks and the {\tt bdd\_swapvar} is unfortunately quite slow since a
full scan of all the nodes must be done both before and after the
swap. Other reordering functions are {\tt bdd\_autoreorder\_times},
{\tt bdd\_reorder\_verbose}, {\tt bdd\_sizeprobe\_hook} and {\tt
  bdd\_reorder\_hook}.


% --------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Error Handling} \index{error handling}

If an error occurs then a check is done to see if there is any error
handler defined and if so it is called with the error code of
interest. The default error handler prints an error message on {\tt
  stderr} and then aborts the program. A handler can also be defined
by the user with a call to {\tt bdd\_error\_hook}.
  
  
% --------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{The C++ interface} \index{C++ interface}

Mostly this consists of a set of overloaded function wrappers that
takes a {\tt bdd} class and calls the appropriate C functions with the
root number stored in the {\tt bdd} class. The names of these wrappers
are exactly the same as for the C functions. In addition to this a lot
of the C++ operators like {\verb | \& - = ==} are overloaded in order
to perform most of the {\tt bdd\_apply()} operations. These are listed
together with {\tt bdd\_apply}. The rest are\\

\begin{tabular}{lll}
     {\bf Operator} & {\bf Description} & {\bf Return value}\\
     {\tt =}  & assignment \\
     {\tt ==} & test & returns 1 if two BDDs are equal, otherwise 0 \\
     {\tt !=} & test & returns 0 if two BDDs are equal, otherwise 1 \\
     {\tt bdd.id() } & identity & returns the root number of the BDD \\
\end{tabular}

\afsnit The default constructor for the {\tt bdd} class initializes
the bdds to the constant false value.  Reference counting is totally
automatic when the {\tt bdd} class is used, here the constructors and
destructors takes care of {\em all} reference counting!  The C++
interface is also defined in {\tt bdd.h} so nothing extra is needed to
use it.


% --------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Finite Domain Blocks} \index{finite domain blocks}

Included in the BDD package is a set of functions for manipulating
values of finite domains, like for example finite state machines.
These functions are used to allocate blocks of BDD variables to
represent integer values instead of only true and false.

New finite domain blocks are allocated using {\tt fdd\_extdomain} and
BDDs representing integer values can be build using {\tt fdd\_ithvar}.
The BDD representing identity between two sets of different domains
can be build using {\tt fdd\_equals}. BDDs representing finite domain
sets can be printed using {\tt fdd\_printset} and the overloaded C++
operator {\tt <<}. Pairs for {\tt bdd\_replace} can be made using {\tt
  fdd\_setpair} and variable sets can be made using {\tt fdd\_ithset}
and {\tt fdd\_makeset}. The finite domain block interface is defined
for both C and C++. To use this interface you must include {\tt "fdd.h"}.

Encoding using FDDs are done with the Least Significant Bits first in
the ordering (top of the BDD). Assume variables $V_0 \ldots V_3$ are
used to encode the value $12$ - this would yield $V_0=0 , V_1=0 ,
V_2=1 , V_3=1$.

An example program using the FDD interface can be found in the
examples directory.


% --------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Boolean Vectors} \index{Boolean Vectors}

\index{arithmetic} Another interface layer for BuDDy implements
boolean vectors for use with integer arithmetics. A boolean vector is
simply an array of BDDs where each BDD represents one bit of an
expression. To use this interface you must include {\tt "bvec.h"}. As
an example, suppose we want to express the following assignment from
an expression
\[
  x := y + 10
\]
\index{addition} what we do is to encode the variable $y$ and the
value $10$ as boolean vectors $y$ and $v$ of a fixed length. Assume we
use four bits with LSB to the right, then we get
\[
  y = \tuple{y_4, \ldots, y_1}
\]
\[
  v = \tuple{1,0,1,0}
\]
where each $y_i$ is the BDD variable used to encode the integer
variable $y$. Now the result of the addition can be expressed as the
vector $z = \tuple{z_4, \ldots, z_1}$ where each $z_i$ is:
\[
  z_i = y_i\ \mbox{xor}\ v_i\ \mbox{xor}\ c_{i-1}
\]
and the carry in $c_i$ is
\[
  c_i = (y_i\ \mbox{and}\ v_i)\ \mbox{or}\ (c_{i-1}\ \mbox{and}
        \ (y_i\ \mbox{or}\ v_i)).
\]
with $c_0$ = 0. What is left now is to assign the result to $x$. This
is a conjunction of a biimplication of each element in the vectors, so
the result is
\[
  R = \bigwedge_{i=1}^4 x_i \Leftrightarrow z_i.
\]
The above example could be carried out with the following C++ program
that utilizes the FDD interface for printing the result.
\begin{verbatim}
#include "bvec.h"

main()
{
   int domain[2] = {16,16};

   bdd_init(100,100);
   fdd_extdomain(domain, 2);

   bvec y = bvec_varfdd(0);
   bvec v = bvec_con(4, 10);
   bvec z = bvec_add(y, v);

   bvec x = bvec_varfdd(1);
   bdd  result = bddtrue;
   
   for (int n=0 ; n<x.bitnum() ; n++)
      result &= bdd_apply(x[n], z[n], bddop_biimp);

   cout << fddset << result << endl << endl;
}
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
The relational operators $<,>,\leq,\geq,=,\neq$ can also be
encoded. Assume we want to encode $x \leq y$ using the same
variables as in the above example. This would be done as:
\begin{verbatim}
#include "bvec.h"

main()
{
   int domain[2] = {16,16};

   bdd_init(100,100);
   fdd_extdomain(domain, 2);

   bvec y = bvec_varfdd(1);
   bvec x = bvec_varfdd(0);

   bdd  result = bvec_lte(x,y);

   cout << fddset << result << endl << endl;
}
\end{verbatim}
%
Please note that all vectors that are returned from any of the {\tt
  bvec\_xxx} functions are referenced counted by the system.

\subsection{C++ Interface}

The C++ interface defines the class
\begin{verbatim}
class bvec
{
 public:

   bvec(void);
   bvec(int bitnum);
   bvec(int bitnum, int val);
   bvec(const bvec &v);
   ~bvec(void);

   void set(int i, const bdd &b);
   bdd operator[](int i)  const;
   int bitnum(void) const;
   int empty(void) const;
   bvec operator=(const bvec &src);
}   
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
The default constructor makes an empty vector with no elements, the
integer constructor creates a vector with {\tt bitnum} elements (all
set to false) and the third constructor creates a vector with {\tt
  bitnum} elements and assigns the integer value {\tt val} to the
vector. Reference counting is done automatically. The i'th element in
the vector can be changed with {\tt set} and read with {\tt
  operator[]}. The number of bits can be found with {\tt bitnum} and
the method {\tt empty} returns true if the vector is a NULL vector.

  
% ==========================================================================
\chapter{Efficiency Concerns}

Getting the most out of any BDD package is not always easy. It
requires some knowledge about the optimal order of the BDD variables
and it also helps if you have some knowledge of the internals of the
package.

First of all --- a good initial variable order is a must. Using the
automatic reordering methods may be an easy solution, but without a
good initial order it may also be a waste of time.

Second --- memory is speed. If you allocate as much memory as possible
from the very beginning, then BuDDy does not have to waste time trying to
allocate more whenever it is needed. So if you really want speed then
{\tt bdd\_init} should be called with as many nodes as possible. This
does unfortunately have the side effect that variable reordering
becomes extremely slow since it has to reorder an enormous amount of
nodes the first time it is triggered.

Third --- the operator caches should be as big as possible. Use the
function {\tt bdd\_setcacheratio} to make sure the size of these is
increased whenever more nodes are allocated. {\em Please note that
  BuDDy uses a fixed number of elements for these caches as default}.
You must call {\tt bdd\_setcacheratio} to change this. I have found a
cache ratio of 1:64 fitting for BDDs of more than one million nodes
(the solitare example). This may be a bit overkill, but it works.

Fourth --- BuDDy allocates by default a maximum of 50000 nodes (1Mb
RAM) every time it resizes the node table. If your problem needs
millions of nodes, then this is way too small a number. Use {\tt
  bdd\_setmaxincrease} to increase this number. In the solitare
example something like 5000000 nodes seems more reasonable.

Fifth --- by default, BuDDy increases the node table whenever there is
less than 20\% nodes free. By increasing this value you can make BuDDy
go faster and use more memory or vice versa. You can change the value
with {\tt bdd\_setminfreenodes}.

So, to sum it up: if you want speed, then allocate as many nodes as
possible, use small cache ratios and set {\tt maxincrease}. If you
need memory, then allocate a small number of nodes from the beginning,
use a fixed size cache, do not change {\tt maxincrease} and lower {\tt
  minfreenodes}.


% ==========================================================================
\chapter{Some Implementation details} \index{implementation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Negated pointers are not used.

\item All nodes are stored in one big contiguous array which is also used
  as the hash table for finding identical nodes.
  
\item The hash function used to find identical nodes from the triple
  $(level, low, high)$ spreads all nodes evenly in the table. This means
  the average length of a hash chain is at most 1.
  
\item Each node in the node table contains a reference count, the {\tt
    level} of the variable (this is its position in the current
  variable order), the {\tt high} and {\tt low} part, a {\tt hash}
  index used to find the first node in a hash chain and a {\tt next}
  index used to link the hash chains. Each node fits into 20 bytes of
  memory. Other packages uses only 16 bytes for each node but in
  addition to this they must keep separate tables with hash table
  entries. The effect of this is that the total memory consumption is
  20 bytes for each node on average.

\item Reference counting are done on the externally referenced nodes only.

\item The ANSI-C {\tt bdd} type is an integer number referring to an
  index in the node table. In C++ it is a class.
  
\item New nodes are created by doubling (or just extending) the node
  table, not by adding new blocks of nodes.

\item Garbage collection recursively marks all nodes reachable from the
  externally referenced nodes before dead nodes are removed.

\item Reordering interrupts the current BDD operation and restarts it
  again afterwards.
  
\item Reordering changes the hash function to one where all nodes of a
  specific level is placed in one continuous block and updates the reference
  count field to include all recursive dependencies. After reordering
  the package returns to the normal hash function.
\end{itemize}
